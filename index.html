FAN TRANSLATION GUIDE:
https://github.com/ncase/crowds#how-to-translate-this-thing

Hello fan-translaters! Thank you so, so much for your help.
I hope you know what you've gotten yourself into.
There's about 3600+ WORDS to translate, including
the Bonus Boxes and References.

To make things easier (or less painful, anyway) I've marked
what needs to be translated and how with big "TRANSLATE" comments.
Ctrl+F for "TRANSLATE" in uppercase to see what needs to be translated!

BUT BEFORE YOU TRANSLATE ANYTHING, DO THIS:
1) Look up the two-letter code of the language you're translating to:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes
2) *COPY* index.html, and name the copy [two-letter-code].html
   For example: de.html, ar.html, zh.html, etc...
3) Translate *THAT* page. Do NOT modify the original index.html!

And once you're done, go to "translations.txt", and follow the
instructions there to let this game "know" your translation exists.

Good luck, and thanks again!

<3,
~ Nicky Case

	The financial system today is built on the Trust of human driven systems to verify transactions
	of fair trade for all members paticpanting. This has led to inefficent and expensive systems
	as only transactions approved by one entity occur in an efficient manner. With all the funds and tranaction history, 
	in one place, humans require the trust rather than the system itself.
	<br><br>
	Because funds are managed by one entity such as banks, when they fail, everyone fails.
	Whether it's hacks or misuse of funds, the result is millions of people are affected or millions of dollars 
	are lost similar to the 2008 Financial Crisis.

<words id="complex_complex_2">
	<span style="line-height:1.3em; display:block;">
		
		Unlike our earlier "fake news" <icon name="red"></icon> contagion,
		this contagion <icon name="yellow"></icon> does <i>not</i> spread to everyone!
		The first few people get "infected", because although they're only exposed to one
		binge-drinker, that binge-drinker is 50% of their friends. (yeah, they're lonely)
		In contrast, the person near the end of the chain did <i>not</i> get "infected",
		because while they were exposed to a binge-drinking friend,
		they did not pass the 50%+ threshold.

		<div style="height:0.75em"></div>

		The <i>relative</i> % of "infected" friends matters.
		<i>That's</i> the difference between the <b>complex contagion</b> theory<ref id="complex"></ref>,
		and our naive it-spreads-like-a-virus <b>simple contagion</b> theory.
		(you could say "simple contagions" are just contagions with a "more than 0%" infection threshold)

	Point is, it's a "good" complex contagion.
	This time, though, let's say the threshold is only 25% &mdash;
	people are willing to volunteer, but only if 25% or more of their friends do so, too.
	Hey, goodwill needs a bit of social encouragement.

		Complex contagions aren't <i>necessarily</i> wise,

	The people at NASA were smart cookies.
	I mean, they'd used Newton's theories to get us to the moon.
	Anyway, long story short, in 1986,
	<i>despite warnings from the engineers</i>,
	they launched the <i>Challenger</i>,
	which blew up and killed 7 people.
	The immediate cause: 
	it was too cold that morning.

	<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

	The less immediate cause: the managers ignored the engineers' warnings.
	Why? Because of <b>groupthink</b><ref id="groupthink"></ref>.
	When a group is <i>too</i> closely knit, (as they tend to be at the top of institutions)
	they become resistant to complex ideas that challenge their beliefs or ego.

	<div style="height:0.9em"></div>

	So, that's how institutions can fall to crowd madness.
	But how can we "design" for crowd <i>wisdom?</i>
	In short, two words:

</words>

<!-- Bonding & Bridging -->

<words id="bonding_1">
	&larr; Too few connections, and an idea can't spread.
	<br>
	Too many connections, and you get groupthink. <div class="rarr"></div> 
</words>

<words id="bonding_2">
	<b>
	Draw a group that hits the sweet spot:
	just connected enough to spread a complex idea!
	<div class="darr"></div>
	</b>
</words>

<words id="bonding_end">
	Simple enough!
	The number of connections <i>within</i> a group is called <b>bonding social capital</b><ref id="social_capital"></ref>.
	But what about the connections...
	<next wiggle>...<i>between</i> groups?</next>
</words>

<words id="bridging_1">
	As you may have already guessed, 
	the number of connections <i>between</i> groups is called
	<b>bridging social capital</b>.
	This is important, because it helps groups break out of their insular echo chambers!
	<br>
	<b>Build a bridge, to "infect" everyone with complex wisdom:</b>
</words>

<words id="bridging_end">
	Like bonding, there's a sweet spot for bridging, too.<ref id="bridge"></ref>
	(extra challenge: try drawing a bridge so thick that the complex contagion
	<i>can't</i> pass through it!)
	Now that we know how to "design" connections <i>within</i> and <i>between</i> groups, let's...
	<next wiggle>...do BOTH at the same time!</next>
</words>

<words id="bb_1">

	<b style="font-size:2em">FINAL PUZZLE!</b>
	<br>
	Draw connections with the groups to spread information from the top group to the whole network. 
	Hint: For groups to be connected, one computer needs multiple connections!

<words id="bb_small_world_1">

	<i>"Here we can take a look at the effects of the blockchain on networks."</i>

   Engineers call this system by definition

	This allows the transfer of data to occur in one part of the network but 
	the tranactions is recorded by all computers in the network.
	This essentialy makes it impossible to go back and change historical data as

	<h3>
	What other kinds of connections are there?
	</h3>

	<div>

	For the sake of simplicity,
	my simulations pretend that people can only be connected through friendships,
	and that all friendships are equal.
	But network scientists <i>do</i> consider other ways we can be connected, such as:

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sprites/bonus/connection1.png" width="250" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>Directional connections.</b> Alice is the boss of Bob, but Bob is not the boss of Alice.
	Carol is the parent of Dave, but Dave is not the parent of Carol.
	"Boss" &amp; "parent" are <i>directional</i> relationships:
	the relationship only goes one way.
	In contrast, "friends" is a <i>bidirectional</i> relationship:
	the relationship goes both ways. (well, hopefully)

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sprites/bonus/connection2.png" width="250" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>Weighted connections.</b> Elinor and Frankie are mere acquaintances.
	George and Harry are Best Friends Forever.
	Even though there's a "friendship" connection in both cases, the second one is stronger.
	We say that these two connections have different "weights".

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sprites/bonus/map.png" width="200" height="200" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	Just remember: <b>all these simulations are wrong.</b> The same way any map is "wrong".
	You see the map on the left? Buildings aren't gray featureless blocks!
	Words don't float above the city! However, maps are useful not <i>despite</i> being simplified,
	but <i>because</i> they're simplified. Same goes for simulations, or any scientific theory.
	Of <i>course</i> they're "wrong" &mdash; that's what makes them <i>useful</i>.

	<h3>
	What other kinds of contagions are there?
	</h3>

	<div>
	
	There are so, so many ways that network scientists can simulate "contagions"!
	I picked the simplest one, for educational purposes.
	But here's other ways you could do it:

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sprites/bonus/contagion1.png" width="250" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>Contagions with Randomness</b>.
	Being "exposed" to a contagion doesn't <i>guarantee</i> you'll be infected,
	it only makes it more <i>likely</i>.

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sprites/bonus/contagion2.png" width="250" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>People have different contagion thresholds.</b> 
	My simulations pretend that everyone has the same threshold for binge-drinking (50%) or
	volunteering (25%) or misinformation (0%). 
	Of course, that's not true in real life, and you could make your sim reflect that.

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sprites/bonus/contagion3.png" width="250" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>An ecology of contagions.</b>
	What if there were <i>multiple</i> contagions, with <i>different</i> thresholds?
	For example, a simple "madness" contagion and a complex "wisdom" contagion.
	If someone's infected with madness, can they still be infected with wisdom?
	Or vice versa?
	Can someone be infected with both?

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
	<br>

	<img src="sprites/bonus/contagion4.png" width="250" height="150" style="float:left; margin-right:1em"/>
	<b>Contagions that mutate and evolve.</b>
	Ideas don't pass perfectly from one person to another the way a virus does.
	Like a game of Telephone, the message gets mutated with each re-telling &mdash;
	and sometimes the mutant will be more infectious than the original!
	So, over time, ideas "evolve" to be more catchy, copy-able, contagious.

	“[small world networks] helped John F. Kennedy (barely) avoid nuclear war!”
	</h3>

	<div>

	Besides the NASA Challenger explosion, the most notorious example of groupthink
	was the Bay of Pigs fiasco.
	In 1961, US President John F. Kennedy and his team of advisors thought
	&mdash; for some reason &mdash;
	it would be a good idea to secretly invade Cuba and overthrow Fidel Castro.
	They failed.
	Actually, worse than failed: it led to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962,
	<i>the closest the world had ever been to full-scale nuclear war.</i>

	<br><br>

	Yup, JFK really screwed up on that one.

	<br><br>

	But, having learnt some hard lessons from the Bay of Pigs fiasco,
	JFK re-organized his team to avoid groupthink.
	Among many things, he:
	1) actively encouraged people to voice criticism,
	thus lowering the "contagion threshold" for alternate ideas.
	And
	2) he broke his team up into sub-groups before reconvening,
	which gave their group a "small world network"-like design!
	Together, this arrangement allowed for a healthy diversity of opinion,
	but without being too fractured &mdash; a wisdom of crowds.

	<br><br>

	And so, with the same <i>individuals</i> who decided the Bay of Pigs,
	but re-arranged <i>collectively</i> to decide on the Cuban Missile Crisis...
	JFK's team was able to reach a peaceful agreement with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
	The Soviets would remove their missiles from Cuba, and in return,
	the US would promise not to invade Cuba again.
	(and also agreed, in secret, to remove the US missiles from Turkey)

	<br><br>

	And that's the story of how all of humanity almost died.
	But a small world network saved the day! Sort of.

And that's it! That's the last of what needed to a TRANSLATE

Thank you so, so much for doing this again, wow.

Finally, go to "translations.txt" and follow the instructions there,
in order to let this game "know" your translation exists.
